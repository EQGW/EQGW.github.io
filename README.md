# EQGW
This is the repository for webpages for the Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop from 2021
on.  It will contain the website for each year's Workshop.  This will include a front page,
a schedule page, some instructions pages for lecturers to use, and for each year a folder.  In
each year's folder will be pages for the individual lectures or computer exercises.  These
will contain links to the PPT or PDF slides for that lecture, for R files for the computer
exercises, and for audio files for the lectures.

However, for now those files will actually be stored on the Google Drive account  fhleqg@gmail.com
in folders for each lecture within a folder for each year.  The lecturers will enabled to put 
materials there.  Users reading the webpages can access them using the links in these webpages.
