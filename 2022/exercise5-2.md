## Exercise 5-2: Threshold model ##

### Josef Uyeda ###
  
  Threshold model exercise. We will use two packages, phytools and its function `threshBayes` and MCMCglmmRAM. 

Note that MCMCglmmRAM is a special version of MCMCglmm that has to be installed using the source package provided in the downloaded folder. This is a source package, so your computer will need to be set up to be able to compile source code in order to complete this part of the exexercise.  If you are running windows, you will need Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and if 
you are running Mac, you will need Xcode (https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/). Why use this package instead of threshBayes? It's orders of magnitude faster and will make your life much easier if you actually want to do threshold analyses in R. Don't worry if you can't get it installed for the workshop, I mainly want to walk you through talking about the results, and what they mean, and how why modeling traits as threshold traits might matter.
