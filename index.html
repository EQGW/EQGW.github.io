   <strong>Please note -- We did not get enough applications for this workshop to enable it to be held in 2023, either as an in-person workshop or as an online 
    workshop.  In 2024 it was not possible to schedule it at Friday Harbor Laboratories.  We are in the process of
    forming a new committee to head the workshop, headed by Josef Uyeda from Virginia Tech University.  Many of the 
  previous lecturers will be involved.  We hope to announce a 2025 in-person Workshop, probably on new dates  
  and at a new location.  Watch this space.</strong>

are shown except for lecturer Patrick Phillips, who left earlier. The photo was taken by Kathy Cowell, to whom thanks.
It was taken on a knoll next to the main Friday Harbor Laboratories building. The back row of people are bending down 
so you can see the scene behind us.  A tour boat can be seen in the background, leaving Friday Harbor. From left to right, a small point sticking
  our from the FHL site, then behind it  
part of Shaw Island, Lopez Island, Turn Island, Pear Point on San Juan Island, and Brown Island can be seen in the background.  On the horizon
mountains near Mount Baker can be seen on the left, then the hills on other islands.</blockquote>

  <P>
These are the webpages for the Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop, which was to be held June 4 - 9, 2023.  In 2023 it would have been an in-person 
workshop held at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington, in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island.  
  
The Workshop has been held yearly since 2011, with the exception of 2020.  Since 2017 the in-person workshops have been held at Friday Harbor Laboratories. In 2021 
  and in 2022, owing to the pandemic, it was held as an online workshop.
<P>
The email address for the worshop is fhleqg@gmail.com.
  <p>
The description of the workshop at the Friday Harbor Laboratories website 
will be found <strong><a href="https://fhl.uw.edu/courses/course-descriptions/course/evolutionary-quantitative-genetics-workshop-2023/">here</a></strong>
<P>
The site you are on right 
now has a schedule of lectures, computer labs, and discussions.    It also has pages for each of these sessions, containing 
lecture projections, notes, and computer exercises. <em>Currently these are mostly the materials for 2022.</em>
For materials from the previous Workshop, go to the "Previous years" link in 
the heading of this page and follow the links to individual lectures and exercises, and the links to videos of the lectures 
for the years in which those were posted.  The 2023 workshop is co-sponsored by The American Society of Naturalists, the Society of Systematic
Biologists, and by the Society for the Study of Evolution.
