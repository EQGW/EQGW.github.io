<div class="alignleft"><blockquote>The workshop photo for the 2019 Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop  All lecturers and participants
are shown except for lecturer Patrick Phillips, who left earlier. The photo was taken by Kathy Cowell, to whom thanks.
It was taken on a knoll next to the main Friday Harbor Laboratories building. The back row of people are bending down 
so you can see the scene behind us.  A tour boat can be seen in the background, leaving Friday Harbor. From left to right, a bit of Point 
Caution on San Juan Island, then behind it  
part of Shaw Island, Lopez Island, Turn Island, Pear Point on San Juan Island, and Brown Island can be seen in the background.  On the horizon
  part of Mount Baker can be seen on the left, then the hills on Orcas Island.</blockquote>

These are the webpages for the Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop, which will be held July 12-16, 2021.  It will
be held online.  It is sponsored by the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington.  In recent years this
workshop has been held in person, at the Labortories in Friday Harbor, San Juan Island, Washington.  In 2020 it was cancelled
owing to the pandemic.  We hope to resume the in-person workshop in 2022.
