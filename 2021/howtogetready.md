## How to get ready for the workshop! ##

Our five day course at Friday Harbor will be fast-paced, so here are some 
points to keep in mind in getting ready for it.  As you can see from the Schedule, 
we generally have a lecture on a topic, followed by some discussion, then 
(but not always) a computer exercise on that topic and then finally some more discussion. 
Before the start of the week, you may want to look over the Schedule and 
do a little background reading for the lectures that interest you the most. 
The problem that you will now confront is that all the material for the 
lectures of interest may not be posted and will not be posted until the day of the lecture. 
No worries!  Go to the Schedule for last year’s version of the course 
(click Previous years in the top ribbon) and find the most relevant lecture.   There 
will often be very similar to the one in this year’s schedule.  On last year's Schedule 
you will find powerpoints/pdfs for lectures, videos of lectures and audio recordings, 
as well as suggested readings.  You can use all of those to prepare for the lectures of special interest to you.

To prepare for the computer exercises, it is important to realize that the exercises 
are of two types.  Some of exercises use special websites and software (e.g., see the 
exercise on estimating G-matrices or the one on G-matrix evolution).  Using the 
instruction documents from theb last two years and ones already posted for this year, 
you could try doing those exercises beforehand if you want.  Other exercises are 
tutorials in R, in which you will follow along as the instructor guides you through 
the tutorial.  You will not need much knowledge to follow along, but you will need 
to execute commands in R and look at and possibly save graphical output.   Often 
the instructor will use R Studio and so it will be useful for you to have R Studio 
installed on your laptop so you can more easily follow along.  R Studio is a 
user-friendly front end for R.  Free downloads are available at 
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/  &nbsp;&nbsp;  After you have successfully 
downloaded R Studio you might practice with it by loading R script and running it. 
You can find instructional videos on YouTube that may help you get acquainted with R Studiio. -SJA
