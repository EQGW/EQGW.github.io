# For workshop lecturers: editing lecture and exercise pages and posting files #

The lecturers in the workshop have been given access to the Github account of the Workshop, to enable them to add pages to the blog, or to edit pages on the blog, or to post files and make links to them. They should start each session by logging into the blog using, not their own username, but the group username that they were given and the password for that account. They will see a WordPress editing page with a black border on the left and at the top. Go to “My Sites” in the upper-left corner of the page, hover your cursor over it to get the menu of sites, and choose the “Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop” as the site.
They should go to  github.com/EQGW/ and once they get there, log in to their own Github account (look in the upper right of the page and "log in" rather than "sign up".


 

## Adding a new lecture or exercise web page ##

I will create pages for all the lectures, and as we add computer labs, I will try to create pages in a timely way.

These instructions show how to do it if I did not make such a page.  If I did make one, simply find the page in this year's folder on the EQGW Github site
and skip this section and go to the one below, about how to edit an existing page.

If we do not already have a page for the lecture, figure out what its name will be.  You can figure 
out what it is by noting which day of the workshop it is on, and which lecture.  If it is the 2nd 
lecture on the 3rd day of the workshop, its name will be \ lecture3-2.md  \ It will be in the 
folder for that year, so in the 2021 Workshop it will be file  2021/lecture3-2.md   \ If you do not 
see the folder for the year, you might see a link named "Code" which will make it visible.

1.  Look in the year folder, and verify that there is no file of that name.  If there is such a file,
skip this section of these instructions and go to the next section, which tells how to edit the file.
1.  If there is no file for the lecture, choose the "Add New File" button and from the drop-down 
menu that appears, choose "Create new file".  This should open the file for editing.  You will see a 
line number (1) on the first line, at the left side of the editing area.
1. There will also be, just above that, a display of the file name, including its path.  The name 
will start with \ EQGW.github.io \ and follow this with the year number and a blank area in which 
you should type the name of the file, such as \ lecture3-2.md\   Don't forget to include the \ .md
1.  From the Schedule page at the workshop site, figure out the name of files for the previous lecture and 
the next lecture.  For example, the lecture preceding this one might have a file  \ lecture3-1.md \ 
and the lecture following it might have the file \ lecture3-3.md
1.  On the first line of the file, we want to have links to the previous and next lectures.  The syntax for the link to the previous lecture is \\<- \[Previous lecture\]\(lecture2-3.md\)
1.  The syntax for the link to the next lecture is a bit more complicated as we want it to

(you could just copy this one, paste it in, and then change it to the correct year, to be “lecture” or “exercise”, whichever the next page is, and to have the right numbers).
It is best to be in Visual mode when typing in most page content. When you finish doing that, it is essential to push the Publish button in the right-hand column of your browser page. You may need to scroll there to find it.  If you do further editing while still editing the page, be sure to push the Update button (which will have replaced the Publish button once the page is published).  Forgetting these will cause your carefully crafted content to be lost.
If you are making a new version of last year’s page for a lecture, you should open that previous year’s page and select all of its contents.  Then paste them into the new page.  This can be done using the Edit menu in Visual mode or by using right-Click (or in MacOS, control-click) on your mouse and choosing the appropriate menu option.  Make sure that you copy from last year’s page and then change to this year’s page before pasting.
Once you have last year’s stuff in, you are ready to edit it, add stuff, etc.
You probably want to link to PDF or PPT files of slides, to files of R exercises, and other media.  Do <em>not put them in this blog</em>, but instead post those files to the Google Drive for the fhleqg Gmail account.  Use the instructions below for “posting files to be linked to from the web page” and also the instructions below it for obtaining the link for each such file to make a link from the web page that you are creating in this list of instructions.
Save your changes using the  Update or Publish  button in the right column of the browser page
You will also want to go to the Schedule page and create a new line for the new page, with a link to it. Before you go there, copy the URL for the new page. It can be copied from the “permalink” that appears at the top of the editing page when you were finished editing the page content, after you had Published or Updated the page.
 

## Editing an existing web page on the Github site ##

Once there is a web page for a lecture or exercise for this year, you may want to edit it further.  Here is how:

***After here in this section, not changed yet to reflect Github***

Make sure you have logged in to the blog’s WordPress site (for example, using the Login page of the blog).  In the upper-right corner of the page, you should see “Howdy, fhleqg”
Find the blog page by using the Schedule and clicking on the lecture or exercise link for that page.
Click on the Edit link, which is visible near the bottom of the page, or becomes visible on moving your cursor over the page name in a list of pages, or which may appear in the stripe at the top of the Dashboard.
If you can’t find the page that way, go to the Dashboard, choose My Sites, and in its menu choose the one which is Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop.  Then look on the menu at the left for Pages and choose All Pages, or look at Posts and choose All Posts. It might be in either of those lists. Then go through that list, moving to new pages of that list till you find the one you want.
Once the page opens for editing, you may want to choose the Visual tab (upper right area).  Then you can type in text, and then mark it and boldface or italicize it with the usual B and I buttons, right/left/center justify using the usual buttons for that, or choose a new font or change the font size for the marked text.
… or you can choose Text mode — then you’re typing raw HTML, so you’d better know what you are doing.
Save your changes using the  Update  button in the right column of the browser page — you may need to scroll some to see it.  Unless you  Update  all recent changes will get lost when you are done.
 

## Posting files to be linked to from the web page ##

***After here in this section, not changed yet to reflect access of these folders by link, which is necessary because of two-factor authentication craziness making it impossible to let you all log in to the
Google account of the Workshop***

Files such as lecture projections (PPT or PDF), or supplementary documents, or R exercises, or audio recordings, are not to be posted on the workshop blog.  Instead, open the Google Drive for the  fhleqg  account, which is not a gmail account but a  uw.edu  account.  It has the password we mentioned above.

Find the “Shared folder” and open it, then find the folder for this year (such as “2019”) and open that.  Find the folder for the lecture or exercise, and open that.  If it does not exist, right-click or Ctrl-click and choose New Folder, and give it the appropriate name such as  Lecture 4.3.

Then you should be able to tow the file from your system onto that Drive screen and drop it there.  You can change its name once it is there, if you want.

 

## Getting the link for one of those files ##

But there is still the matter of getting the address of the file, and posting a link to it on the appropriate lecture or exercise web page.

***After here in this section, not changed yet to reflect access of these folders by link, which is necessary because of two-factor authentication craziness making it impossible to let you all log in to the
Google account of the Workshop***

 Open a window with the Google Drive page, with you logged in appropriately.
Find the folder with the file, and open that folder.
(You may need to do this only once)  The files you put in the Google Drive folders should be accessible by anyone who has the link.  This ensures that clicking on the link in the blog reaches the file.  To make that select the file and click on the icon above and to the right that looks a person with a + sign on their shoulder.  Choose the setting that states that “anyone with the link can view” the file (not just anyone at UW with a link).
Right-click or Crtl-click on the file name.
A menu will open.  Choose “Get Sharable Link”.
A box will open with the URL address for the link.  Select it and copy it.
Now go to the Edit screen for the blog page, in Visual mode.  Have the text that will indicate the link selected.
Choose the symbol for Insert/Edit Link, which looks like a little chain with three links.
Insert the URL in the box provided.
Press the return-arrow button which immediately follows the URL field.
Don’t forget to Publish or Update the web page after that.
